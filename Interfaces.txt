>An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behavior. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.

>The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. 

1.an interface could only have abstract methods (methods without a body) 

2.public, static, and final variables by default

3.It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java.

4.It is used to achive abstraction

5.by interfaces ,we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.

6.it can be used to achive loose coupling
	{Loose coupling is a design principle in software engineering, particularly in object-oriented programming like Java, that aims to minimize the dependencies between different components of a system.}

7.Any class can extend only one class, but can implement multiple interfaces.

8.A class can extend another class, and similarly, an interface can extend another interface.

9.only calss can implement an interface but the interface can not be implemented by calss.
